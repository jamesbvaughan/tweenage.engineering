## About the project

https://tweenage.engineering

## Development

I'm using [Next.js 13 with the new `app` directory layout](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs), which is still technically in beta, but other than that it's a pretty standard Next.js app.

For the 3D bits I'm using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) via [React-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction).

## Contributions

If you find any opportunities for small fixes and improvements, feel free to open a pull request and I'll try to respond promptly.

If you have ideas for large changes, I'd love to hear them! But please [reach out via email](mailto:james@jamesbvaughan.com) before spending too much time working on them so that we can make sure our goals are aligned.

In either case, thank you!
I'm not expecting contributions here but would certainly appreciate them.
